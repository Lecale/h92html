# h92html
Simplistic conversion of .h9 file to html with OpenGotha css

Tired of Tournament Directors not sending you the html export? Grab the .h9 from EGD and backbreak it!

* launch on command line with h92html, follow the prompts
* doesn't handle things like a geek who only has 1 name
* doesn't calculate the exact finishing positions you'd get if you applied tiebreakers
* may very well completely fail on non OpenGotha .h9 files
* Otherwise a reasonable crufty tool for backbreaking .h9 from the EGD
